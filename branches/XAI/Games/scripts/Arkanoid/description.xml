[B]Includes 4 playing mode:[/B] - Classic Mode &#45;&#62; Arkanoid (1986) 32 Level, no boss "Doh" level in future - Tournament Mode &#45;&#62; Tournament Arkanoid (1987) 32 Level, no boss "Doh" level in future - Mode Custom Level &#45;&#62; Playing with staff levels - Practice Mode &#45;&#62; Play a particular level of Arkanoid (1986) or Tournament Arkanoid (1987). Includes a level editor, either to a full level or for edit an original level.  Management scores not completed on this Alpha.  Known bugs should be corrected on the next release. The ball can sometimes passed through a indestructible block "Gold" and stuck the other side.  The only solution for now is to leave the script and start again - Again the ball sometimes it is bounded and turn around but the angle changes slowly and it feels it is taken, then the only solution for the impatient like me , is out of the script and start again.
