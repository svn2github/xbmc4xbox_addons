GENERAL

This is a simple XBMC add-on to enable you to listen to more than 200,000 digital recordings of classic computer game and demoscene music. On request the audio is rendered and streamed from a server run by http://www.exotica.org.uk. The search functions in the same way as the search at http://www.modland.com.

"The demoscene is a computer art subculture that specializes in producing demos, which are non-interactive audio-visual presentations that run in real-time on a computer. The main goal of a demo is to show off programming, artistic, and musical skills." /Wikipedia

USAGE

The search box will match against fields "file name, author, music format, collection"

To make a search enter one or more keywords with an optional prefix of +, - or |. + means the word must appear in the data. - means the word should not appear in the data. If no prefixes are used, the + prefix is assumed so the word must appear in the search results. To match an exact phrase enter the string in quotes. To make this clearer here are some examples

  * apples oranges would match data that contains both the words apples and oranges (in any order)
  * +apples +oranges is equivalent to above.
  * +apples -oranges would match data that contains the word apples but not oranges.
  * |apples |oranges would match data that contains either the word apples or the word oranges.
  * "apples and oranges" would match data that contains the phrase apples and oranges 

You may also use the wildcard * for partial word matching. For example

    * lem* would match any words starting with lem such as lemons or lemmings. 

Note that in boolean mode the wildcard only works appended to a word. You can not use it at the start of a word.

The boolean search can only search on words of 3 characters or more in length, unless searching for a phrase where it can match against phrases containing shorter words (so long as one word is more than 3 characters). 

INSTALL

The add-on is available in the official XBMC repository. 

If you still want to install manually, move the "plugin.audio.modland" directory into your "addons" directory.

Streaming is done in realtime from a server in the UK run by buzz [at] exotica.org.uk. There is a limit to the number of tunes that can be streamed. The limit is set to deter script/bot downloading, and should not affect people listening to the tunes in realtime.
