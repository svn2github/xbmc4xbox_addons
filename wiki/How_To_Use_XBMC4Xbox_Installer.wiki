==2. Setting new XBMC4Xbox to start as a default dashboard==

Before setting the new build as a default dashboard, you should test areas that you use (video/music playback, plugins, scrapers etc). If anything is broken, you should not continue further and stick with your current version.

Go to Programs > XBMC4Xbox Installer > Builds > Set running XBMC4Xbox as default dashboard. This step will look for dashboard configuration files as follows:

  * shortcut .cfg in (this order):
    * C:\fonts\dashboard
    * C:\
    * E:\
    * E:\Dash
    * E:\Dashboard
    * F:\
  * x2config.ini in:
    * E:\
    * F:\

When one found, you will be asked to confirm update - note the path to the new build.

IMPORTANT: 

*Do a COLD boot* (restarting Xbox through Shutdown menus, going through flubber and everything else). 

Go to System Info and check that you are running the new build (meaning the shortcut configuration was updated succesfully). Notice the build version at the bottom of the screen.

==3. Deleting older XBMC4Xbox installations==

You should not proceed to this step without going through step 2. Now running the new build you can proceed in deleting the older builds (that is zip downloads and actual installations).

Run XBMC4Xbox Installer > Builds > Delete old installations

[http://addons4xbox.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/XBMC%20SVN%20Installer/Builds%20-%20Step%203a.png]

Choose an older installation / zip file you want to delete - note the dialog presents entries from installation path (e.g. E:\apps). 

It should not present you with the new build (that you are running now, succesfully going first through Step 1 and Step 2 above).
