Version 1.02 (30 May 2012)

(njtaylor) Fixed episodes not playing via "11" server ("Script Error")

(alnicol) Fixed error preventing download action

(spoyser) Allow spaces in download path

Set cache folder to the originally intended folder: [XBMC]/userdata/plugin.video.4od/cache

Problem: Changes in the episode listing webpage caused the plug-in to stall indefinitely
Fix 1: Update the plug-in to match the webpage changes
Fix 2: Change the way the listings are parsed so that future changes won't cause the plug-in to hang, even if the episodes won't play, or show in the listing.

Dynamically determine the URL of the 4od swf player from the webpage, resolving any URL redirect in the process. This should resolve the "plays for 1 or 2 minutes and then stops" problem.
