    <summary>Hulu video plugin</summary>
    <description>NOTE: Geo-Locked To USA ONLY.  Videos from Hulu.com   IMPORTANT INFO Thanks to NobodyHere: You need to disable all of these settings - "network pre-roll", "pre-roll ads", "trailing ads", "commercial breaks". You also need to set the Default CDN to "akamai". The only issue I've encountered with these settings is that the Fox network programs do not work. This is seemingly due to the way the episodes are segmented into pieces instead of using one larger stream.</description>
