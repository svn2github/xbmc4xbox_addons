        <description>When I was ten years old, I started watching stand up comedians on TV.

I fell in love with them and I'm just as fascinated with stand up comedy today.

When I started doing TV, I saved every appearance on every show I did.

I thought it might be fun to go through all of it and pick out three bits each day that still amuse me for some reason or another.

I've also included stuff I'm doing now, and I'll be adding new stuff as I go.

Somewhere out there are ten year olds just waiting to get hooked on this strange pursuit.

This is for them.
I'm just hoping somehow it will keep this silliness going.
