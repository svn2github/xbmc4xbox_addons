xbmcswift
=========

A micro framework to enable rapid development of XBMC plugins.

## Version
0.1.2  
Currently under heavy development. Will be adding some full documentation soon.


## Features
* Command line interface to run plugin scripts while testing scraper code.
* Run the addon from the command line and within XBMC without changing any
  code.
* Helper libraries to make common XBMC api operations easy, like adding items,
  getting settings.
* Advanced plugin routing without the need to deal with complicated URLs and
  query strings.
